# PWA Icons Setup

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create two icon files:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons

### Option 1: Use an Online Tool
1. Visit https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload your logo/image
3. Generate the required sizes
4. Download and place them in the `public/` folder

### Option 2: Use Image Editing Software
1. Create a square image (512x512 recommended)
2. Export as PNG at 192x192 and 512x512 sizes
3. Place both files in the `public/` folder

### Option 3: Use a Simple SVG (Temporary)
You can create a simple SVG icon and convert it to PNG using tools like:
- https://convertio.co/svg-png/
- https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png

## Icon Requirements
- Format: PNG
- Sizes: 192x192 and 512x512 pixels
- Purpose: Should work as "any maskable" icons
- Location: `public/icon-192.png` and `public/icon-512.png`

Once the icons are in place, the PWA will be fully functional!
